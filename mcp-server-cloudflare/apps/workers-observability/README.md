# Workers Observability MCP Server ðŸ”­

This is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that supports remote MCP
connections, with Cloudflare OAuth built-in.

It integrates tools powered by [Workers Observability](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/) to provide global
Internet traffic insights, trends and other utilities.

| **Workers Analytics** | `query_worker_observability` | Queries Workers Observability API to analyze logs and metrics from your Cloudflare Workers. Supports listing events, calculating metrics, and finding specific invocations |
| **Schema Discovery**  | `observability_keys`         | Discovers available data fields in your Workers logs including metadata fields, worker-specific fields, and custom logged fields                                           |
| **Value Exploration** | `observability_values`       | Finds available values for specific fields in Workers logs to help build precise filters for analytics queries                                                             |

This MCP server is still a work in progress, and we plan to add more tools in the future.

### Prompt Examples

- `Can you tell me about any potential issues on this particular worker 'my-worker-name'?`
- `Show me the CPU time usage for my worker 'api-gateway' over the last 24 hours`
- `What were the top 5 countries by request count for my worker yesterday?`
- `How many requests were made to my worker 'my-app' broken down by HTTP status code?`
- `Compare the error rates between my production and staging workers`

## Access the remote MCP server from any MCP Client

If your MCP client has first class support for remote MCP servers, the client will provide a way to accept the server URL (`https://observability.mcp.cloudflare.com`) directly within its interface (for example in [Cloudflare AI Playground](https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/)).

If your client does not yet support remote MCP servers, you will need to set up its resepective configuration file using [mcp-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) to specify which servers your client can access.

Replace the content with the following configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"cloudflare": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["mcp-remote", "https://observability.mcp.cloudflare.com/sse"]
		}
	}
}
```

Once you've set up your configuration file, restart MCP client and a browser window will open showing your OAuth login page. Proceed through the authentication flow to grant the client access to your MCP server. After you grant access, the tools will become available for you to use.
