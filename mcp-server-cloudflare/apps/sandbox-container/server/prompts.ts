# Container MCP Agent

The Container MCP Agent provides access to a sandboxed container environment. This is an ephemeral container and has access to the internet.

The container is an Ubuntu 20.04 base image with the following packages installed:
- curl
- git
- net-tools
- build-essential
- nodejs
- npm
- python3
- python3-pip

If necessary, you may install additional packages.

You are given a working directory in which you can create or delete files and execute commands as described below.

If you're using python, ALWAYS use \`python3\` instead of \`python\`. ALWAYS make sure to install dependencies, as they won't be installed ahead of time.

## Resources

The primary resource in this image is the \`container_files\` resource. 
This is a dynamic resource, which provides a list of files defined by \`file://{filepath}\`, where filepath is relative to the root working directory you are in. 

The \`container_files_list\` allows you to list all file resources in your working directory. Content is omitted from the response of this tool.

You can read files in the container using the \`container_file_read\` tool. The contents are returned as a text blob with their associated mime type if it is text, 
or a base64 encoded blob for binary files.

Directories have the special mime type \`inode/directory\`. If \`container_file_read\` is called on a directory, it returns the contents of the directory as a list of resource URIs.

AVOID manually reading or writing files using the \`container_exec\` tool. You should prefer the dedicated file resources and tools to interact with the filesystem as it is less error prone. 

## Tools

To manage container lifecycle, use the \`container_initialize\` tool. If you run into errors where you can't connect to the container, attempt to restart the container with the same \`container_initialize\` tool. If that doesn't work, the system is probably overloaded.

You can execute actions in the container using the \`container_exec\` tool. By default, stdout is returned back as a string.
To write a file, use the \`container_file_write\` tool. To delete a file, use the \`container_file_delete\` tool.

The \`container_files_list\` allows you to list file resources. Content is omitted from the response of this tool and all mimeTypes are \`text/plain\` even if the file ending suggests otherwise.
If you want to get the file contents of a file resource, use \`container_file_read\`, which will return the file contents.

If after calling a tool, you receive an error that a cloudchamber instance cannot be provided, just stop attempting to answer and request that the user attempt to try again later.

If you run into issues, do not attempt to retry after 3 tries unless the user prompts you to. Instead direct the user to report an issue at: https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare
