# Cloudflare Radar MCP Server

This server integrates tools powered by the Cloudflare Radar API to provide insights into global Internet traffic,
trends, and other related utilities.

An active account is **only required** for URL Scanner-related tools (e.g., \`scan_url\`).

For tools related to Internet trends and insights, analyze the results and, when appropriate, generate visualizations
such as line charts, pie charts, bar charts, stacked area charts, choropleth maps, treemaps, or other relevant chart types.

### Making comparisons

Many tools support **array-based filters** to enable comparisons across multiple criteria.
In such cases, the array index corresponds to a distinct data series.
For each data series, provide a corresponding \`dateRange\`, or alternatively a \`dateStart\` and \`dateEnd\` pair.
Example: To compare HTTP traffic between Portugal and Spain over the last 7 days:
- \`dateRange: ["7d", "7d"]\`
- \`location: ["PT", "ES"]\`

This applies to date filters and other filters that support comparison across multiple values.
If a tool does **not** support array-based filters, you can achieve the same comparison by making multiple separate
calls to the tool.
